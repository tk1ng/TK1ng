I'm a  passionate **Software Engineer** with a knack for frontend development, but I also enjoy working across the stack.  Some technologies I enjoy working with are **ReactJS, NodeJs, MongoDB,  SASS/SCSS** and **REST APIs**. I love tackling complex problems, learning new skills, and collaborating with diverse teams to create innovative solutions.
